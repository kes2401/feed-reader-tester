## Project Overview

This project contains a web-based application that reads RSS feeds and uses a test suite written with [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/). The test suite contains specs that test the following:

* an allFeeds array, which holds details of the relevant RSS fees, is defined and not empty
* each feed in the allFeeds array contains a name key
* each feed in the allFeeds array contains a url key
* the application menu button is hidden when the page first loads
* the visibility of the menu changes each time the menu icon is clicked
* the asynchronous loadFeed() function completes its operation and that there is at least 1 entry in the feed container
* content actually changes each time the asynchronous loadFeed() function is called on a new feed from the menu
